# VObject parser for Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/untitaker/rust-vobject.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/untitaker/rust-vobject)

This is a primitive VObject and iCalendar parser for Rust, originally written
for [a simple addressbook script](https://github.com/untitaker/mates.rs) and
based on [rust-peg](https://github.com/kevinmehall/rust-peg).

This is an experiment by me to learn Rust, and the API is pretty bad.
